      <p>I am fascinated by various computer science technologies, such as machine learning. Thus, this passion for gaining insights from data drives me to study Information Systems at the University of Münster with a focus on business intelligence. In internships and real-life projects at the student consultancy move, I put the acquired theoretical knowledge from my studies into practice. Furthermore, I work on personal projects in my free time and work at the chair of Information Systems, fostering my analytical and conceptual abilities.</p>
