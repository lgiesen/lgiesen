      <p>I am fascinated by information technologies, especially Machine Learning. This passion drives me to study Information Systems at the University of MÃ¼nster with a focus on Business Intelligence. Through internships and part-time work, I have applied my theoretical knowledge in practice. In personal leisure projects and practical projects at the student consultancy <a href="https://move-ev.de/" target="_blank">move</a>, I continuously enhance my analytical and conceptual skills. Currently, I aim to further develop my leadership qualities as chairman of the board and project manager at move.</p>
